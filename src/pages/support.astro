    <h2>Support</h2>
    As monks, we try to keep our needs minimal and be easy to support, but there
    are things that are useful for the maintenance of the body. Monks arenâ€™t allowed
    to use money, so they depend on having their basic requisites offered to them
    directly.

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
      {
        support.map(async (support) => {
          const { Content } = await support.render();
          return (
            <Accordion title={support.data.title}>
              <Content />
            </Accordion>
          );
        })
      }
