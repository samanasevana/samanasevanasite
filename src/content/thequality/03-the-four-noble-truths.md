description: "The ultimate purpose of the Awakened One's teaching—understanding and transcending the cycle of suffering"
order: 3
---

The ultimate purpose of the Awakened One's teaching was to go beyond the cycle of birth, aging, and death, grief, mourning, pain, suffering, and tension.

Understanding the painful nature of this cycle is the first noble truth.

The second noble truth is that the origin of this pain is craving–for sense pleasures, existence, and non-existence.

The third noble truth is that this painful cycle comes to an end when craving comes to an end. When all the good qualities have been developed to maturity one has the tools to be able to abandon craving moment-to-moment and come to an end until there is no trace of it left.

The fourth noble truth is the eight part path leading to the cessation of the cycle of pain and suffering. This path is:
1. Right View: Taking on the view of the four noble truths as the way out of pain.
2. Right Resolution: Resolutions of renunciation, non-hostility, and non-cruelty
3. Right Speech: Refraining from lies, divisive speech, coarse speech, and useless chatter
4. Right Action: Refraining from killing living beings, stealing, and wrong sexual actions
5. Right Livelihood: Refraining from livelihood which involves transgressing the previous three parts of the path
6. Right Effort: Effort at developing good qualities and abandoning bad qualities as described above and below.
7. Right Remembering: Remembering what are skillful qualities and unskillful qualities and the four noble truths in the context of the experience of the body, feelings, the psyche, and the qualities.
8. Right Concentration: Four progressively more subtle states of focus.
    1. The first focus still possesses thought and mental movement along with joy and pleasure.
    2. The second focus is fully concentrated after thought and mental movement cease, but still experiencing joy and pleasure.
    3. The third focus is after joy ceases and is replaced by observation, but still experiencing pleasurable feelings.
    4. The fourth focus is after the pleasurable feeling ceases, and one feels only observation and neither painful nor pleasurable feeling.
