Furthermore, his teaching details good qualities and bad qualities, how to develop them, and where they lead. 


He taught that these 10 forms of wrong actions always lead to painful consequences, in this life or after death. These are:
1) Killing living beings
2) Taking what is not given
3) Wrong Sexual Actions: illegal sexual activity, as well as sex with someone who is engaged, married, or under the care of parents or relatives. 
4) Lying
5) Speaking Divisively
6) Coarse Speech
7) Useless Chatter
8) Intentions of Greed
9) Intentions of Hostility
10) Believing that there are no moral consequences of good and bad actions & that there is nothing beyond the material world.

There are good qualities which are still in the realm of this cycle of existence, but which lead towards more refined, heavenly, or godly existences, and can offer a sense of balance with which one can go further:

1) Kindness (mettā) 
2) Compassion (karuņā) 
3) Happiness  (muditā) 
4) Observation (upekkhā)
