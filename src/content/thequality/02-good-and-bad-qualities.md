## The Ten Wrong Actions

He taught that these 10 forms of wrong actions always lead to painful consequences, in this life or after death. They are divided into three categories:

**Actions of Body:**
- **Killing living beings** - Taking the life of any sentient being, from the smallest insect to humans
- **Taking what is not given** - Stealing or taking anything that has not been freely offered
- **Wrong Sexual Actions** - Primarily sexual relations with someone who is in a relationship or under the care of parents or relatives

**Actions of Speech:**
- **Lying** - Speaking falsehood with the intention to deceive
- **Speaking Divisively** - Speech that creates discord and separates those who are united
- **Coarse Speech** - Harsh, abusive, or insulting language
- **Useless Chatter** - Gossip and meaningless talk that wastes time and distracts from what is beneficial

**Actions of Mind:**
- **Intentions of Greed** - Covetousness and desire for what belongs to others
- **Intentions of Hostility** - Ill-will, hatred, and thoughts of harming others
- **Wrong View** - Believing that there are no moral consequences of good and bad actions & that there is nothing beyond the material world

## The Good Qualities

There are good qualities which were still in the realm of this cycle of existence, but which lead towards more refined, heavenly, or godly existences, and can offer a sense of balance with which one can go further:

- **Kindness (Mettā)** - The genuine wish for all beings to be happy and well
- **Compassion (Karuṇā)** - The wish for beings to be free from suffering
- **Contentment (Santuṭṭhi)** - Being satisfied with what one has, not constantly craving more
- **Observation (Sati)** - Clear awareness and mindfulness of present experience

These qualities serve as a foundation for deeper practice and create the conditions for progress toward liberation.
