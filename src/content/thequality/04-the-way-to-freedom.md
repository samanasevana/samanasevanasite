One of the additional sets of good qualities he taught were the seven parts of awakening:

1. **Remembering** the natural law of the four noble truths.  
2. **Examination of the natural law** through an awareness and investigation of it.  
3. Putting forth **Energy** to develop it and abandon the impulses that lead away from it.  
4. The natural arising of **Joy** that comes with awareness of and development of the Quality.   
5. The **Relaxation** of the body and mind which comes with joy.
6.  The **Concentration** of one's psyche.   
7. The state of **Impartiality** from which one can see things as they really are. 

With the noble eight-part path and seven parts of awakening developed one can know and see through one's experience the relationships between craving and various types of physical and emotional pain and the freedom that comes from relinquishing that craving. When this wisdom is completely internalized, one has no trace of craving left, and there is nothing that could lead to a birth in this world again.
