One of the additional sets of good qualities he taught were the seven parts of awakening:
- Remembering of the Quality of that awakening of that freedom and the way to get there  
- Distinguishing the Quality through an awareness and investigation of it.
- Putting forth Energy to develop it and abandon the impulses that lead away from it.
- The natural arising of Joy that comes with awareness of and development of the Quality.
- The Relaxation of the body and mind which comes with joy.
- The Concentration of one's psyche.
- The state of Observation from which one can see things as they really are.


With the eight part path and seven parts of awakening developed one can know and see though one's experience the relationships between craving and various types of physical and emotional pain and the freedom that comes from relinquishing that craving. When this wisdom is completely internalized, one has no trace of craving left, and there is nothing that could lead to a birth in this world again.
