The Awakened One taught in the context of an understanding of past lives and other dimensions of existence. This worldview forms the foundation for understanding why we practice and what we are working towards.

This basic understanding of the universe had three fundamental principles:

**1. Moral Consequences (Karma)**  
There are moral consequences of good and bad actions. Every intentional action of body, speech, and mind creates results that will ripen either in this life or in future lives. This is not a system of punishment or reward, but a natural law like gravity.

**2. Multiple Realms of Existence**  
There is this material world, but also a world beyond this one in which one can be born into according to the good and bad qualities one develops and actions one takes. These realms range from hellish states of intense suffering through the human realm to heavenly realms of refined pleasureâ€”all still within the cycle of birth and death.

**3. Direct Knowledge is Possible**  
There are people who have realized for themselves direct knowledge of this world and the world beyond. The Buddha himself directly perceived these truths through his awakening, and this direct knowledge is available to anyone who follows the path of practice to its completion.
