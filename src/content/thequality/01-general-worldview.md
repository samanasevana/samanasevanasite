The Awakened One taught in the context of an understanding of past lives and other dimensions of existence. 

This basic understanding of the universe has three basic parts:
1) There are moral consequences of good and bad actions, either in this life or after death. 
2) There is this material world, but also worlds beyond this one into which one can be born, according to oneâ€™s good and bad actions of body, speech, and mind.
3) There are people who have realized for themselves direct knowledge of this world and worlds beyond.
