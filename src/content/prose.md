The Buddha in his Own Words, Translations of Suttas
This section includes a number of translations excerpts of “Threads” the Canonical teachings of the Awakened One. All translations are by Venerable Jeffrey.

The Fruits of Monasticism-DN 2
This discourse includes the most extensive version of the Buddha’s most frequent description of his teaching. In it he goes step-by-step thoroughly describing the progression through the fruits and ultimate purpose of his teaching.

The Four Noble Truths-SN 56.11
The Characteristics of Not-Soul-SN 22.59
The Burning Discourse-SN 35.28
After he was awakened, these first three of the Awakened One’s teaching constituted the main structure of his teaching throughout his lifetime. He taught these three same basic structures hundreds of times.

A more detailed description occurs in one of his longer explications of the noble eight-part path.

Consequences of Morality-MN 41
This teaching recounts when the Awakened One described the types of immoral actions which lead to births in hell.
