title: "Offering Robes"
---

The easiest way to offer robes would be to make an intention known to the monk that you would like to provide robes when they are needed, and then he can let you know when the need arises or if he can wait until the robes season.

Robes or robe cloth are generally received during the robes season, which is the last month of the rainy season. In India and southeast Asia, the rainy season is the full moon in July to the full moon in November. Āyasmā Guṇavīro has been observing it here from the full moon in November to the full moon in March, the rainy season in California. So the robes season would be the full moon in February until the full moon in March.
