title: "How can I offer robes?"
---

The easiest way to offer robes would be to make an intention known to the monk that you would like to provide robes when they are needed, and then he can let you know when the need arises or if he can wait until the robes season.

Robes or robe cloth are generally received during the robes season, which is the last month of the rainy season. In India and southeast Asia, the rainy season is the full moon in July to the full moon in November. Bhante Gunaviro has been observing it here from the full moon in November to the full moon in March, because that corresponds to the rainy season in California. So the robes season would be from the full moon in Jan 20 - Feb 21 to the full moon in Feb 18 - March 20.

During the rainy season a monk is supposed to be settled in one place. The benefit of that time is that the robes undergo some wear during the rains, and for much of the rest of the year a monk may be moving around so it is a convenient time to offer robes. Though if a monk is in need of a robe he can receive another robe at any time of the year, but he cannot receive extra robes so he would need to relinquish one of his existing robes.
