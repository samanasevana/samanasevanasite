title: "Can I offer money?"
---

Monks can't accept money, nor can they have others accept money for them, nor can they consent to money being deposited for them. However, if a lay person is looking to offer a requisite either to the Sangha, the Order of Monks, or to an individual monk, a monk can designate someone as someone who can do services for them.

A lay person may offer money to other lay people for the sake of making an offering to a monk, but monks should not look for or consent to money.
