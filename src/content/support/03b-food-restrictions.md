title: "Are there any food restrictions?"
---

Generally monks are encouraged to be content with any food that is offered. However, there are a few restrictions which occasionally come up. 

If someone kills an animal for the sake of monks, and the monks see, hear, or suspect that that is the case, the monks aren’t allowed to eat the food. However, if the killing of the animal was not in any way connected to the offering, meat is generally allowable. 

Also, monks are not allowed to destroy living plants, which includes living seeds. So, a monk wouldn’t be able to eat things like sprouts of various kinds unless they were cut up. Also, when fruits have seeds which are not able to be removed, (e.g. most berries, cherry tomatoes, etc.) they would also need to be cut up to be allowable. 

There are also other more rarely occurring restrictions such as a monk is not able to eat the meat of tigers, lions, bears, dogs, horses, snakes. 

Otherwise, generally all food is acceptable. People are generally just encouraged to offer whatever they are inspired to make and feel good about offering. The purity of the intention is more important than the specific type of food offered.
