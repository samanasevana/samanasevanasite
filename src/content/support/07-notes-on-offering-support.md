title: "How can I offer other miscellaneous support?"
---

Other things do come up from time to time as things that would be useful, books, nail clippers, or rides, or transportation costs, or other things.

If one would like to offer anything else, the best way is to simply make an open ended offer that one would like to provide anything that he might need. Similarly, if one doesnâ€™t specify the timeline, the monk has a rule that he can only accept it for four months. However, if one specifies that one would like the offer to be for longer or shorter the monk can take up the offer on a longer or shorter timeline.
