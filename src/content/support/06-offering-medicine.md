title: "Offering Medicine"
---

Because it is difficult to know in advance when one will need medicine and medical treatment, the best way to offer to pay for these things is to make an offering directly to the monk. Unless one specifies otherwise, the monk will be able to take up that request for up to four months.

Also, if one has anything in mind about the types of things one would like to provide it is useful to specify them (i.e. I would like to offer you herbs, or the costs of any medical treatments, or acupuncture, etc.). If it is intended for absolutely any type of treatment or medicine one can specify that as well.

For expenses more than several hundred dollars, Āyasmā Guṇavīro would likely call or email several people to see if they would like to share the costs.
