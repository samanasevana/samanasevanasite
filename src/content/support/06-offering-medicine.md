title: "How to offer medicine or medical treatment?"
---

Because it is difficult to know in advance when one will need medicine and medical treatment, the best way to offer to pay for these things is to make an offering directly to the monk. Unless one specifies otherwise, the monk will be able to accept that request for up to four months.

Also, if one has anything in mind about the types of things one would like to provide it is useful to specify them (i.e. I would like to offer you herbs, or the costs of any medical treatments, or acupuncture, etc.). If it is intended for absolutely any type of treatment or medicine one can specify that as well.

For expenses less than ~$300, he would likely simply call or email someone who has made an offer. For expenses more than that he would likely call or email several people who have made offers or send a message to the Whatsapp group to see if people would like to share the costs.
