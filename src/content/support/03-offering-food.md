## How can I offer food?

Monks can’t store food, cook for themselves, or eat after midday. So, offerings of food need to be made during the morning with enough time before midday to eat. Midday is around **1 PM during daylight savings time (Mar-Nov)** and **12 PM after daylight savings ends (Nov-Mar).**

There are two main approaches to offering food:

### 1. Alms Round

If monks don’t have a specific invitation for the day, their norm will be to go on alms round. They will walk around town until they have enough food for the day or it starts to approach midday. Generally, alms round begins at **approximately 7:30-8 AM** and ends around **10:30-11 AM** to sit down and eat. However, this is variable and may be extended during daylight savings time.

### 2. Formal Meal Offering

One can stop by either the day before, several days in advance, or have someone stop by on one’s behalf to ask to offer a meal on a specific day.

To allow enough time to eat, it is best to **serve by about 10:30 AM** during non-daylight savings time and **11:30 AM** during daylight savings time. The meal can be offered either where the monk is staying or at another place within about **4 miles**.

For formal meal offerings, the monk generally won’t be eating before or after the meal.

## Do monks have any food restrictions?

In general, the Buddha encouraged monks to be content with any food. However, there are a few things that are **not allowable**:

- **Meat restrictions**: Meat is allowable if it is **pure in three ways**:

  - The monastic does **not see, hear, or suspect** that the animal was killed for his own sake.
  - If an animal was **killed specifically for the sake of a monastic**, it is **not allowable**.
  - If the killing of the animal was **completely independent** of the offering, it is allowable.

- **Raw ingredients**: Monks **can’t cook**, so they **can’t receive**:

  - Raw grains
  - Beans
  - Raw meat, etc.

- **Living plants**: Monks have a rule against **destroying living plants**, so they **can’t receive or eat**:

  - Sprouts
  - Living seeds
  - Fully living plants (e.g., a living carrot or onion)

  Most raw seeds sold in markets are **pasteurized** and would not be able to grow again, making them allowable. However, **fruits with seeds that can still grow** (e.g., most berries, pomegranates) **are not allowable** unless they are:

  - Cut up
  - Cooked
  - Processed in some way

- **Certain meats are unallowable**, including meat from:
  - **Predators** (e.g., lions, tigers, mountain lions, bears)
  - **Companion animals** (e.g., dogs, horses, elephants)
  - **Snakes**
