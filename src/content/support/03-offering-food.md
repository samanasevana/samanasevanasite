title: "How can I offer food?"
---

Monks can’t store food, cook for themselves, or eat after midday. So, offerings of food need to be made during the morning with enough time before midday to eat. Generally, solar noon is around 1PM during daylight savings time (Mar-Nov), and around 12PM after daylight savings ends (Nov-Mar).

There are two main approaches to offer food.

The first is alms round. If monks don’t have a specific invitation for the day, their norm will be to go on alms round. They will walk around town until they have enough food for the day or it starts to approach midday. Generally, alms round begins at approximately 7:30-8AM, and ends around 10:30-11AM to sit down and eat, but that is very variable and may be extended during daylight savings time. People are also welcome to come to offer food at the residence.

The second is to make a formal meal offering. One can stop by either the day before or several days in advance if necessary or have someone stop by on one’s behalf and ask to offer a meal on a specific day. In general to have enough time to eat, it is good to plan to serve by ~10:30AM during non-daylight savings time, and ~11:30AM during daylight savings time. The place can be either where I’m staying or at another place within about 4 miles. For formal meal offerings, the monk generally won’t be eating before or after the meal. Additionally, monks have a number of rules around eating and so generally eat out of the alms bowl and in silence.
