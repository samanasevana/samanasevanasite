title: "Offering Shelter"
---

There are a variety of ways to offer shelter to a monk. The easiest way to go about it is to simply offer and describe the circumstances available and let him decide.

The main priorities for shelter is that it has a sense of solitude and has access to a means for a meal.

For a place to have a sense of solitude it could be anything from a piece of land to a separated unit to a garage to a separate room. A shared space generally wouldn’t work for very long, but could still be useful for a short-term stay or if the monk is ill. Monks have a rule that they can’t share a room with a non-ordained person for more than three nights and can’t share a room with a woman for even a night.

For a place to have a means for a meal it could either be either close enough to someplace the monk could go for alms round or could include an offering of food if the place is too far to go for alms. A normal alms route would be about 2 miles out and 2 miles back.

During the first or last three months of the four months of the rains (i.e. the full moon of November to the full moon of February, or the full moon of December to the full moon of March), the monk should in general be in one place, so would not be able to accept an offer of shelter for less than that time period.

During the rest of the year the monk can accept an offer of shelter for any period of time, short or long. Also, unlike other requisites, a monk can ask for shelter as long as it is not being built specifically for him in which case there are significant restrictions.

Along with the basic requirements, the most important priority is the sincerity of the offer and whether the people offering have an appreciation for and understanding of the role of a monastic.
