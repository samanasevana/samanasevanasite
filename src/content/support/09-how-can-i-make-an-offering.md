title: "How can I make an offering?"
---

Ideally, offerings of support should be made directly to monks. To avoid confusion, it is helpful to first express your intention to make an offering to the monk to see if it can be accepted.

When making an open-ended offer of support, it's very helpful to specify the duration or time frame of your offer (for example, "I'd like to offer financial support in case of emergency for the next 3 months" or "I'm available to help provide short-term shelter throughout this year").

If you'd like to check if Bhante Guṇavīro can accept your offering, you can email [samanasevana@gmail.com](mailto:samanasevana@gmail.com) and a lay supporter can ask on your behalf.
