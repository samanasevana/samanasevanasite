title: "How can I make an offering?"

Ideally, offerings of support should be made directly to Bhante Guṇavīro. When making an open-ended offer of support, it's very helpful to specify the duration or time frame of your offer (for example, "I'd like to offer financial support in case of emergency for the next 3 months" or "I'm available to help provide short-term shelter throughout this year").

If Bhante is temporarily unavailable, you can send your offer to [samanasevana@gmail.com](mailto:samanasevana@gmail.com) and a lay supporter will ensure your offer reaches him when he becomes available.
