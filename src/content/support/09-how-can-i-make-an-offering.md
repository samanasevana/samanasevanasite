title: "How can I make an offering?"
---

For food, one can offer a meal directly by inviting to a meal.

For robes, one can make an invitation to offer a robe whenever it is needed, or make an offering of robes during the robes season (Feb-March).

For medicine, one can make an offer directly to a monk inviting him to cover any medical expenses or medicines which are needed. Specificity helps in the types of expenses or products which one has in mind (e.g. I would like to offer herbs and supplements, or I would like to offer acupuncture or chinese medicine, etc.) The default is that unless otherwise specified monks can take up the offer for four months. If one would like to offer for longer than that one can specify the time frame (I would like to cover any medical costs up to $1000 for the next 2 years, I would like to cover any emergency expenses forever, etc.)

For shelter, invitations to a place can be made directly if one has a separate space available. Sharing rooms with a layperson isn’t allowed for more than three days for a monk, but if one has a single room or separate unshared space, one can offer it to monks.

For other miscellaneous things, one can either offer directly whatever toiletries one might think are useful or similarly put forth a general offer. Other types of things that are sometimes useful are offers for books or transportation, computer use, shower or bathing facilities, or other random things that might come up.

More longer term, someone or a group of people can offer land or a monastery to the Sangha as a whole as a place to live.

Ideally, offerings of support should be made directly to monks. However, if for whatever reason that isn’t feasible, you can email [samanasevana@gmail.com](mailto:samanasevana@gmail.com) and a lay supporter can ask on your behalf.
