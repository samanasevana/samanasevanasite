Monks, this is the noble truth of pain. Birth is painful. Aging is painful. Death is painful. Being stuck with those who are not loved is painful. Being separated from those who are loved is painful. Not getting what one wants is painful. In brief, the five masses which are taken on are painful.

Monks, this is the noble truth of the coming together of pain. That craving, which wants to become over and over again, that goes along with delight and infatuation, delighting here and there–that is craving for sensuality, craving for existence, craving for non-existence.

Monks, this is the noble truth of the dissolution of pain. The fading away and dissolution without a trace of that very craving, given it up, relinquished completely, released, without clinging.

Monks, this is the noble truth of the way leading to the dissolution of pain. It is this very eight part noble path. That is– right view, right intention, right speech, right acting, right livelihood, right effort, right remembering, right concentration.
