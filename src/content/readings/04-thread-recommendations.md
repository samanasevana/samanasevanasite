This is a list of major topics the Buddha regularly returned to as well as some representative teachings on those topics as well as further reading in case people are interested in either getting a general taste of the canon or interested in going deeper on certain topics.

**Intellectual Foundations of the Path**

**The Overarching View of the Path**  
_The most frequent way the Buddha described the path to people who were not familiar with it is often termed the “Gradual training.” It occurs many times in the suttas._  
Example: Digha Nikaya 2  
Further Reading: Also pieces of it recur in DN 3-13, Majjhima Nikaya 51, 77, 39, 37

**Dependent Origination**  
_The Buddha originally discovered the path by looking for the cause of pain and suffering. He goes through twelve deeper and deeper causes of which the deepest cause is ignorance of the four noble truths._  
Ex. Digha Nikaya 15  
FR: Samyutta Nikaya Ch 12

**Right View**  
_Right View is the foundation of the path. It is the first part of the noble eightfold path, and offers the entry into what the path is and how to come out of suffering. It is most commonly described as the four noble truths, but in many circumstances is presented from slightly different angles._  
Ex. DN 1, also the end of Digha Nikaya 22 includes a thorough description of the four noble truths  
FR: MN 141, MN 9, MN 1, 102, 49 117

**Wholesome and Unwholesome**  
Prior to speaking about the four noble truths, the Buddha often encouraged developing a clear understanding of what is wholesome and what is not wholesome. Common wholesome qualities are giving, morality, renunciation. Common unwholesome qualities are sense pleasures, hatred, cruelty as well as the five barriers.  
Ex. MN 2  
FR: MN 8, 113, MN 13-14, MN 128, 114, DN 25

**Results of Deeds**  
_The Buddha often emphasized the importance of belief in kamma, that good and bad deeds have good and bad results, as well as that there exists something beyond the material world. This is key not only to liberation, but even to mundane right view._  
Ex. Majjhima Nikaya 135-6  
FR: MN 142, 101, Anguttara Nikaya 3:24, 3:100, 10:217-220 MN 41-2

**Parts of the Path Related to Meditation**

**Breath Remembrance**  
_One of the most common frameworks that the Buddha used for meditation was integrating the breath with the parts of awakening and the development of calm and discernment in 16 steps._  
Ex: Majjhima Nikaya 118  
Further Reading: Samyutta Nikaya Ch 54

**Teachings on Not Soul**  
_One of the most common teachings that the Buddha taught to monks and nuns, which frequently culminated in their awakening, was guiding them through the five parts of one’s identity and understanding each of those parts to be not really one’s own, oneself or one’s soul._  
Ex. Samyutta Nikaya 22.59  
Further Reading: Samyutta Nikaya Ch 22, especially 22.57, 22.79, 22.81

**Teaching on the Six Sense Bases**  
_The main other framework that the Buddha used for teaching monks and nuns to see impermanence in the context of their own experience was the six sense bases. In this framework, the Buddha guided monks and nuns to see each internal and external sense door, the perception of each sense door, contact, and sensation each as impermanent. This too, very commonly culminated in their awakening._  
Ex. Samyutta Nikaya 35.28  
FR: Samyutta Nikaya Ch 35, MN 137, MN 143-152

**The Establishments of Remembrance**  
The four establishments of remembrance are a piece of the eightfold noble path. Occasionally the Buddha integrates the whole of the path into these four establishments of remembrance.  
Ex. Digha Nikaya 22  
FR: Majjhima Nikaya 10, 119
