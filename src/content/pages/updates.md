Good evening all,

Bhante plans on giving a Dhamma talk at Skypark on Tuesday, June 24th at 1:30pm.

In early July, Bhante will likely return to my parents' home in Scotts Valley. Dhamma talk schedule will be updated as we get closer to the date.

Hi all - Bhante is currently residing somewhere in the forests of Scotts Valley. You'll likely, but not guaranteed, to see him on alms round in the mornings between Kings Village Shopping Center and Heavenly Roadside Cafe between 7am and 11am until the middle of June. After that, I would wager that he'll either return to my parents' home in Scotts Valley, or to the forests of Ben Lomond.

More details to come! If you'd like to hear more frequent updates, you are welcome to join our WhatsApp group. Please email [samanasevana@gmail.com](mailto:samanasevana@gmail.com) with your phone number to be added.

Thx,
Jordan

Bhante has officially arrived in Scotts Valley! He's staying at the home of my parents for the time being located at 31 Taryn Ct, Scotts Valley, CA 95066. Please park outside the gate on the street and look for the sign that says "Bhante's Residence" - walk through the backyard and knock on the sliding glass door.

Bhante is available most days from 6:00pm to 7:30pm for drop-in visits. On Uposatha days (May 5, 11, 19, 26), there will be a Dhamma talk and Q&A from 6:00pm to 8:00pm-ish. If you'd like to schedule a private meeting, or have any questions, please email [samanasevana@gmail.com](mailto:samanasevana@gmail.com).

Bhante will likely remain in Scotts Valley until at least May 27th and possibly longer.

Warm regards,

Jordan

Hi all, Bhante’s time in Santa Cruz has come to an end. I know he’s touched a lot of people’s hearts with his wholesome actions and teachings, myself included.

While Bhante's schedule is fluid and unpredictable, his likely path will take him from Santa Cruz to Felton, then Scotts Valley, then San Jose, then the greater Bay Area until October or November.

Starting in October or November, he will settle down for the winter until March.

If you have a place to offer as short-term or long-term shelter, please feel free to reach out at [samanasevana@gmail.com](mailto:samanasevana@gmail.com). For more information on offering support, please visit the [support page](/support).
