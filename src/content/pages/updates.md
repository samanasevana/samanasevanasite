## Updates & Schedule

_Last updated: 2025-04-13_

Hi all, Bhante’s time in Santa Cruz has come to an end. I know he’s touched a lot of people’s hearts with his wholesome actions and teachings, myself included.

While Bhante's schedule is fluid and unpredictable, his likely path will take him from Santa Cruz to Felton, then Scotts Valley, then San Jose, then the greater Bay Area until October or November.

Starting in October or November, he will settle down for the winter until March.

If you have a place to offer as short-term or long-term shelter, please feel free to reach out at [samanasevana@gmail.com](mailto:samanasevana@gmail.com). For more information on offering support, please visit the [support page](/support).

Warm regards,
Jordan
