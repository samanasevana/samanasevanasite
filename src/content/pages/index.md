<u>On Offering Support:</u>
It is a wonderful opportunity to offer support to Bhante Gunaviro. Ideally, offerings should be made directly in person; a fairly dependable time for this is during drop-in hours. If you would like to offer a meal, please be aware that some advance notice may be needed to coordinate.

If you are unable to make an offering directly, you can email samanasevana@gmail.com and a lay supporter can ask on your behalf. For more information on offering support, please see the [Support](/support) page.

<u>Contact:</u>  
For general inquiries, offerings of support, or to join our WhatsApp group, please contact [samanasevana@gmail.com](mailto:samanasevana@gmail.com), an email address maintained by a lay supporter. If your message is intended for Bhante Gunaviro, a lay supporter will do their best to pass it along. However, please understand that responses may take time, especially if he is on retreat or otherwise unavailable.
