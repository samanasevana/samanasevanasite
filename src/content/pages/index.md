Welcome to our community space for those interested in the monastic path, supporting monastics in general, and the journey of Venerable Guṇavīro in particular.

Created and maintained by lay supporters, this website serves as a resource for those wishing to stay informed about Guṇavīro Bhikkhu travels and practice. It also provides reflections on the Dhamma, guidance on engaging with Buddhist monks, and answers to common questions.

For general inquiries, offerings of support, or to join our WhatsApp group, please contact [samanasevana@gmail.com](mailto:samanasevana@gmail.com). If your message is intended for Guṇavīro Bhikkhu, a lay supporter will do their best to pass it along. However, please understand that responses may take time, especially if he is on retreat or otherwise unavailable.
