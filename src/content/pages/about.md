## About

The name Samaṇa Sevanā comes from Pāḷi, the language the Buddha spoke. The term “Samaṇa” is a word for someone who is living the live of a renunciate and seeking peace, tranquility, calm. “Sevanā” is a word meaning to follow and serve.

Āyasmā Guṇavīro is a Buddhist monk. He began practicing Buddhism in 2001, began monastic training in 2015, and received full ordination in 2018 at Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery with Luang Por Pasanno as his preceptor. Since 2022 he has been travelling independently, trying to follow the rules the Buddha laid down as closely as possible. He tends to settle for the rainy season, and move around on foot for the rest of the year.

This website was originally created by lay supporters to assist Āyasmā Guṇavīro in his journey, but it also serves as a broader resource for those interested in Buddhism and the monastic path. Organized and maintained by lay supporters, it provides updates on his travels and teachings while also offering reflections on the Dhamma and guidance on how to respectfully engage with Buddhist monks. Whether you wish to stay connected with Āyasmā Guṇavīro, deepen your understanding of Buddhism, or learn how to relate to monastics, we hope this space proves helpful.
