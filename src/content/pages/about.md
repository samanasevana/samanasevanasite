## About

Created and maintained by lay supporters, this website serves as a resource for guidance on relating to Buddhist monks and answers to common questions.

The name Samaṇa Sevanā comes from Pāḷi, the language the Buddha spoke. The term “Samaṇa” is a word for someone who is living the live of a renunciate and seeking peace, tranquility, calm. “Sevanā” is a word meaning to follow and serve.

Guṇavīro Bhikkhu (Jeffrey Hancuff) is a Buddhist monk. He began practicing Buddhism in 2001, began monastic training in 2015, and received full ordination in 2018 with Luang Por Pasanno as his preceptor. Since 2022 he has been travelling independently, trying to follow the rules the Buddha laid down as closely as possible. He tends to settle for the rainy season, and move around on foot for the rest of the year.

"Bhikkhu" is the Pali term for a monk.

"Bhante" is a Pali term of respect used for monastics.

"Gunaviro" is a monastic name given by his preceptor which has the meaning "hero of virtue" or "one who is undaunted in goodness."
