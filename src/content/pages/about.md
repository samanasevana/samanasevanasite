## About

The name Samaṇa Sevanā comes from Pāḷi, the language the Buddha spoke. The term “Samaṇa” is a word for someone who is living the live of a renunciate and seeking peace, tranquility, calm. “Sevanā” is a word meaning to follow and serve.

Guṇavīro Bhikkhu is a Buddhist monk. He began practicing Buddhism in 2001, began monastic training in 2015, and received full ordination in 2018 at Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery with Luang Por Pasanno as his preceptor. Since 2022 he has been travelling independently, trying to follow the rules the Buddha laid down as closely as possible. He tends to settle for the rainy season, and move around on foot for the rest of the year.
