title: "Why are you dressed like that?"
---

The Buddha laid down restrictions on the type and number of clothes a monastic should have to limit clothing to just what is necessary and functional. Monks generally have three robes, an inner robe, and upper robe, and a double-layer outer robe.

The robes are practical and also serve as a useful signal that one is living a life of renunciation. It is useful for people to be able to recognize that a monk is on a spiritual path and approach them with that understanding. It helps frame the discussion and relationship in a way that is less personal and more spiritually directed.
