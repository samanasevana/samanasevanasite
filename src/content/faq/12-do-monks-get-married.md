title: "Do monks get married?"

No. Celibacy is one of the foundational principles of Buddhist monasticism. The first rule that the Buddha laid down, and one of the most serious ones, is that if a Buddhist monk has sex, he is immediately “defeated,” immediately no longer a monk, and cannot re-ordain for the rest of his life.

The reason for this is that the core of the Buddha’s teaching was that craving is the root cause of the cycle of birth, aging, and death and all the pain that goes along with it. The craving for sensuality, including craving for any of the pleasures of the senses, is the coarsest form of craving. The only way of coming to an end of the cycle of pain is to come to a complete end of that craving that fuels the fusions that pull us back into the world. One of the qualities of a fully awakened being is that they are completely celibate (AN 9.7).
