title: "Do you talk?"
---

Monks do talk. Actually, the Buddha prohibited monks from taking vows of silence. However, he laid down a number of restrictions around the circumstances in which monks speak on the Buddha’s teaching.

Short questions are always welcome. However, alms round isn’t an ideal circumstance for long spiritual discussions both because of the time limitation monks have around eating as well as because it is worth sitting down and having someone’s full attention. Afternoons or after the meal tend to be a better time for longer discussions.
