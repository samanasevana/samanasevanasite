title: "What tradition are you a part of?"
---

I consider myself a follower of the Buddha. I have great faith in his accomplishments and the thought and care that he laid out in structuring his teaching and training. I try to follow the rules he laid down as closely as possible.

As far as what texts I believe to be the most authentic version of his teaching and training, I believe the suttas and the vinaya from the Pāḷi Canon to be the most authentic version of his teachings which are generally accessible.
