title: "Why don’t you use money?"
---

The Buddha was very clear that money should never be accepted as a monastic or even for a novice beginning the training. The fundamental direction of the monastic life is towards abandoning the pursuit of sensuality and sense pleasures. Money primarily serves to purchase things of the world. Because of its fungible quality, the lay person can’t know whether that money is being spent on necessities or indulgences.

Additionally, accumulating money can also assure security and stability. The giving up of money forces monastics to live a life much more vulnerable to uncertainty over whether people offer food or other requisites or not. Facing the uncertainty of life is a key part that allows one to see the vulnerability that is inherent in the human condition. No matter how much money one has, everything that has come together has the nature to fall apart.

The monastic form is built to try to accept that reality and consciously abandon the pursuit of trying to control and identify with our bodies and the world and cultivate rewards that come from wholesome qualities, and develop the freedom that comes from letting it go.
