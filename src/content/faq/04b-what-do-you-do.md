title: "What do you do?"
---

I try to be a good example. When the circumstances are appropriate, I teach what I’ve learned.

Most of my daily life is spent meditating, studying the Buddha’s teachings, teaching, and attending to daily chores such as alms round, cleaning, etc.

There are a variety of tools that the Buddha offered on how to cultivate wholesome qualities and how to abandon unwholesome qualities. So, depending on the day, the circumstances and the internal state, I’m usually using one or more of them.

Broadly these are:

- establishing wholesome qualities like kindness, compassion, contentment, observation,
- abandoning unwholesome qualities like sensual desire, hostility, agitation, sluggishness,
- establishing awareness of the body, feelings, the psyche, the qualities which are arising,
- converging the psyche,
- seeing things as they are, and
- abandoning craving.
