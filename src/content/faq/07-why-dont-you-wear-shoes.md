title: "Why don’t you wear shoes?"
---

The Buddha laid down a rule for monastics that while in town, unless one is ill, the monastic should not wear footwear. Outside town or when one can’t walk barefoot comfortably, sandals are permitted. Shoes are mostly prohibited for monks.

There are both practical and spiritual reasons for going barefoot. On a practical level, a monastic life is aimed at trying to live with the bare minimum of what is needed to keep the body going. If one can do without something, it is one less thing that one has to carry around and worry about.

Also, while barefoot one is more in touch with the beings or plants that one might be stepping on. One is aware of whatever damage one is doing to one’s environment, because one is vulnerable to the pain that might come from that damage. Going barefoot makes one more aware and sensitive to the world around.

On a spiritual level, when one is walking barefoot one is more in touch with the body. The more one is aware of the cold or the hot, it is a means to establish awareness of what is going on which is an important piece of the path to awakening.

Being barefoot and experiencing the discomfort of it is a constant reminder of the vulnerability of the body, its fragility, and how precarious life is. Because the Buddha saw that attachment to the body drove much pain and suffering and the process of birth into this material world, much of the training is towards abandoning attachment to the body. Giving up the comfort of wearing shoes is an important reminder of its vulnerability and a reason to let go.
