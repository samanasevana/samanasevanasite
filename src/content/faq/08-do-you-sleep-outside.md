title: "Do you sleep outside?"
---

Monks are allowed to accept places to stay, but there are some restrictions. They aren’t allowed to share a room with an unordained person for more than three days, and aren’t allowed to share a room with a woman even for a night.

However, when traveling, monks most commonly sleep outside. A monk may live outside for many months or may accept an offer if it becomes available.

During the four rainy months of the year, monks are supposed to be sheltered in one place and not travel during either the first three or last three months of that time. Generally these four months are observed from full moon to full moon (E.g. in India and southeast Asia these are observed the full moon in July-full moon in November, in california full moon in November-full moon in March, etc.).
