title: "What is the bowl for?"
---

The Buddha laid down rules for monks against receiving money and storing food. So, each day, unless they are fasting or someone has made an invitation to offer them food, they go on alms round. The bowl is to receive food that people freely offer. That is the food that they eat for the day. If there is extra food that day, they either give it away or offer it back to nature.
