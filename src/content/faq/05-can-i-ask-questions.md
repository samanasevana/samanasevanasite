title: "Can I ask questions?"
---

It is totally appropriate to approach a monk with questions about the suffering one is going through and how to deal with it or how to develop qualities that might be able to help support living a skillful and fulfilling life.

Personal questions aren’t encouraged because the role of a monk isn’t intended to be a personal one. It is intended for guidance and inspiration that ultimate freedom is possible.
