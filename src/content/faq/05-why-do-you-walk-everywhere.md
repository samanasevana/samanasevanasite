title: "Why do you walk everywhere?"
---

Most commonly, people see me walking in the mornings with my bowl. When I’m doing that, I’m accepting the food for the day. Monks aren’t allowed to use money or store food, so unless I’m fasting or a lay person has arranged to offer a meal that day, I go on alms to accept the food for the day.

The Buddha also laid down a rule for monks that they should not accept rides in vehicles unless they are ill. It changes the nature of one’s life when one tries to follow this rule and keeps a standard of simplicity. The standard of not just living without money, but also living a very simple life of poverty was important in keeping one’s focus on spiritual development.

The monastic direction is an example that sustained happiness, peace, and freedom don’t come from acquiring material things, they come from abandoning material things, cultivating wholesome qualities, and letting go.

It is important that monks be accessible to normal people. Walking, whether it is for the sake of traveling or for going on the daily alms round, is an important way to be available for people who might be interested in making contact with a monastic.

When travelling in a vehicle, one often destroys many living beings in the process. In general monastics go to significant effort not only to avoid intentionally killing living beings, but also avoid things like digging in the earth, which may unintentionally kill them. When walking, one generally does much less damage.
