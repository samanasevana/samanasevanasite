title: "How can I receive teachings?"
---

I try to offer talks once a week if I have a venue to offer them. Usually it is either at a park or the place where I’m staying. Also, sometimes people invite me to another venue to offer a talk or invite me to a meal to receive teachings either where I’m staying or at their home.
