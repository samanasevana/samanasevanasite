title: "What’s a Buddhist monk?"
---

A Buddhist monk is someone who dedicates their life to the path of spiritual development and ultimate freedom that the Buddha, the awakened one, discovered and taught.

The core piece of the Awakened One’s teaching is the four noble truths.

1. There is pain inherent in our existence,
2. The origin of this pain is craving for sensuality, existence, and non-existence,
3. The dissolution of that pain comes with the complete abandoning that craving,
4. There is a path to developing the spiritual qualities necessary for the complete dissolution of that pain.

A monk is someone with faith in those core teachings and trying to put them into practice according to the thousands of rules the Buddha laid out for monastics. This involves a life dedicated to morality, simplicity, purity of intention, and letting go.
