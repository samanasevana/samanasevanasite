title: "How can I find you?"
---

It can sometimes be difficult to track me down if I’m moving around. The community of lay supporters and the Whatsapp group might be the best way to find out recent information on my whereabouts. Feel free to email samanasevana@gmail.com.

If I’m staying somewhere for a period of time and there is someone I can let know, I often offer talks on the observance days, the full, new, and half moons, and if someone offers me a place to stay, I usually have additional availability as well, usually in the late afternoons or evenings.

Alms rounds are a bit unpredictable even when I’m stable because often people will offer a meal or I’ll fast and won’t be on almsround at all.
