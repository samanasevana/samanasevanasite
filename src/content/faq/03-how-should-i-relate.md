title: "How should I relate to a monk?"
---

The role of a monk is aimed at ultimate freedom and coming out of the cycle of birth, aging, and death. It isn't intended to be a primarily teaching or social role. It is intended to provide inspiration towards a direction that has the potential to liberate us all. The leaving behind of material wealth and worldly pursuits offers the space for the complete dedication to the establishment of wholesome qualities, abandoning unwholesome qualities, establishing awareness, convergence, and letting go.

Monastics are very much available for spiritual guidance at the right time and place, but aren't generally looking for unnecessary socializing. Approaching them with an appreciation and desire to support and learn from their direction is the most appropriate way to interact.
