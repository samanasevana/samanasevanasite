title: "How should I relate to a monk?"
---

The role of a monk is aimed at ultimate freedom and coming out of the cycle of pain. It is intended to provide inspiration and guidance towards a direction that has the potential to liberate us all.

The main way to relate to a monk is with an understanding of that role. If one feels inspired to approach and seek teachings, make offerings, or offer gestures of respect, from a Buddhist perspective it is considered an act which has great kammic rewards in oneâ€™s life or after death.

Monastics are very much available for spiritual guidance at the right time and place, but aren't generally looking for unnecessary socializing. Approaching them with an appreciation for and desire to support and learn from their direction is the most appropriate way to interact.
