title: "Do you sleep outside?"
---

Monks are allowed to accept places to stay, but there are some restrictions. They aren’t allowed to share a room with an unordained person for more than three days, and aren’t allowed to share a room with a woman even for a night.

However, when traveling, monks most commonly sleep outside. A monk may live outside for many months or may accept an offer if it becomes available.

During the four rainy months of the year, monks are supposed to be sheltered in one place and not travel during either the first three or last three months of that time. Generally these four months are observed from full moon to full moon (E.g. in southeast Asia these are observed from the full moon in July to the full moon in November, in California I am observing it from the full moon in October 22-Nov 21 to the full moon in Feb 18 - March 20).
