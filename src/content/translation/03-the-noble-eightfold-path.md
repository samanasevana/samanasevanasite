Friend, Which is “right concentration?”

With the calming of thought and mental movement, internally settling down, the will having set down and unified, one enters into the second focus without thought or mental movement, with joy and pleasure born of concentration.

With the fading of joy, dwelling in observation, remembering and fully aware, experiencing pleasure throughout the body, that which the noble ones make known “This one is observing, remembering, and dwelling in pleasure.” one enters into the third focus.

With the abandoning of pleasure, and the abandoning of pain, with joy and suffering having previously come to an end, purified through observation and remembering, one enters into the fourth focus without pain or pleasure.
