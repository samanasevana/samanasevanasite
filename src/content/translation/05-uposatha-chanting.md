## Homage Chant

_Namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammāsambuddhassa._  
_Namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammāsambuddhassa._  
_Namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammāsambuddhassā._

Homage to that auspicious one, the worthy one, the fully and completely awakened one.

Homage to that auspicious one, the worthy one, the fully and completely awakened one.

Homage to that auspicious one, the worthy one, the fully and completely awakened one.

_E.g. MN 100_

## Three Refuges

_Buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi;_  
_Dhammaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi;_  
_Saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi._

_Dutiyampi buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi;_  
_Dutiyampi dhammaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi;_  
_Dutiyampi saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi._

_Tatiyampi buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi;_  
_Tatiyampi dhammaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi;_  
_Tatiyampi saṅghaṃ saraṇaṃ gacchāmi._

I take refuge in the Awakened One.  
I take refuge in the Quality.  
I take refuge in the Order.

Even a second time, I take refuge in the Awakened One.  
Even a second time, I take refuge in the Quality.  
Even a second time, I take refuge in the Order.

Even a third time, I take refuge in the Awakened One.  
Even a third time, I take refuge in the Quality.  
Even a third time, I take refuge in the Order.

_Khuddakapāṭha 1 & MV Ch 1 (2nd recitation section)_

## Kindness

_Mettā sahagatena cetasā ekaṁ disaṁ pharitvā viharati,_  
_tathā dutiyaṁ_  
_tathā tatiyaṁ_  
_tathā catutthaṁ._

_Iti uddhamadho tiriyaṁ sabbadhi sabbattatāya_  
_sabbāvantaṁ lokaṁ_  
_mettā sahagatena cetasā_  
_vipulena mahaggatena appamāṇena_  
_averena abyāpajjena pharitvā viharati._

With a will imbued with kindness,  
one lives pervading one direction,  
so the second,  
so the third,  
so the fourth.

And so one lives pervading above, below, around and absolutely everywhere,  
every bit of the universe,  
with a will imbued with kindness,  
extensive, expansive, immeasurable,  
free from vengeance and hostility.
