Monks, everything is burning. What is everything that is burning?

The eye is burning, monks. Forms are burning. Eye perception is burning. Eye contact is burning.

The ear is burning, monks. Sounds are burning. Ear perception is burning. Ear contact is burning. This sensation which arises based on ear contact, pleasurable, painful, or neither pleasurable nor painful, that too is burning. What are they burning with? I say they are burning with the fire of infatuation, the fire of hatred, the fire of delusion, burning with birth, aging, death, sadness, grief, pain, suffering, and tension.

The nose is burning, monks. smells are burning. Nose perception is burning. Nose contact is burning. This sensation which arises based on nose contact, pleasurable, painful, or neither pleasurable nor painful, that too is burning. What are they burning with? I say they are burning with the fire of infatuation, the fire of hatred, the fire of delusion, burning with birth, aging, death, sadness, grief, pain, suffering, and tension.

The tongue is burning, monks. Tastes are burning. Tongue perception is burning. Tongue contact is burning. This sensation which arises based on tongue contact, pleasurable, painful, or neither pleasurable nor painful, that too is burning. What are they burning with?

The body is burning, monks. Tangibles are burning. Body perception is burning. Body contact is burning.

The mind is burning, monks. Qualities are burning. Mind perception is burning. Mind contact is burning.

Having seen like this, monks, a disciple who has learned from the noble ones becomes disenchanted with the eye, becomes disenchanted with forms, becomes disenchanted with eye perception, becomes disenchanted with eye contact, becomes disenchanted with the sensation which arises based on eye contact, whether pleasurable, painful, or neither pleasurable nor painful.

becomes disenchanted with the mind, becomes disenchanted with qualities, becomes disenchanted with mind perception, becomes disenchanted with mind contact, becomes disenchanted with the sensation which arises based on mind contact, whether pleasurable, painful, or neither pleasurable nor painful.

Having become disenchanted, infatuation fades away. With the fading of infatuation, one is freed. Having been freed, there is the knowledge of freedom: “Births have run out. The holy life has been completed. What was to be done has been done. There is no more coming back into being.” While speaking this response, the psyches of those thousand monks were freed from impulses.”
