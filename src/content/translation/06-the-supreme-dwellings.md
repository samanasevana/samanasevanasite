With a will imbued with kindness, one lives pervading one direction, so the second, so the third, so the fourth.

And so one lives pervading above, below, around and absolutely everywhere, every bit of the universe, with a will imbued with kindness, extensive, expansive, immeasurable, free from vengeance and hostility.

With a will imbued with compassion, one lives pervading one direction, so the second, so the third, so the fourth.

And so one lives pervading above, below, around and absolutely everywhere, every bit of the universe, with a will imbued with compassion, extensive, expansive, immeasurable, free from vengeance and hostility.

With a will imbued with contentment, one lives pervading one direction, so the second, so the third, so the fourth.

And so one lives pervading above, below, around and absolutely everywhere, every bit of the universe, with a will imbued with contentment, extensive, expansive, immeasurable, free from vengeance and hostility.

With a will imbued with observation, one lives pervading one direction, so the second, so the third, so the fourth.

And so one lives pervading above, below, around and absolutely everywhere, every bit of the universe, with a will imbued with observation, extensive, expansive, immeasurable, free from vengeance and hostility.
